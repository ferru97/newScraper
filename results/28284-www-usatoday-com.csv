It's typically signifies that someone is either uninteresting or unattractive. But what really makes someone left swipe on a photo? For some users, it’s cigarettes.The marketing campaigntruth has worked to end smoking among young adults since 2000, launched its latest video “Left Swipe Dat” as part of its #FinishIt campaign. Legacy, a leader in public health, created the video which premiered during the Feb. 8 Grammy Awards.Artists -- including Becky G, Fifth Harmony and King Bach -- star in the video, which argues that it’s unattractive for a person to post photos of himself or herself smoking on social media. While some young adults may find smoking attractive, a study by found that people get nearly double the matches on dating apps if they are not smoking in their profile pictures.Cas Marburger, who manages social media for truth, says she couldn’t have asked for a better response from young adults.RELATED: Despite risks, students embrace hookah trend“The celebs and icons in the music video -- like Becky G, Fifth Harmony, King Bach and the intergalactic dolphins -- have been absolute champions,” Marburger says. “Their participation and support of truth has sparked a firestorm of people talking about why they choose not to smoke, chose to quit smoking or why they’re down to help #LeftSwipeDat.”Sarah Kocher, student at Augustana College says the advertisement was one of the most ""clever"" she has seen.""I have spoken to several other students about the video because I loved it so much,” Kocher says. “One of my friends also said she thought it was genius and quite well done."".In an effort to end both social and everyday smoking, truth argues that Millennials can put a stop to tobacco use. The organization goes beyond informing viewers about traditional forms of tobacco consumption, such as smoking cigarettes, by highlighting the dangers of newer trends like hookah and flavored cigars.RELATED: Is Iowa's legal smoking age about to go up in flames?Various smoking facts are posted on the truth website. For example, #230 says, “in an average one-hour hookah session, you inhale 100 to 200 times as much smoke as from a single cigarette.”The #FinishIt campaign takes a different approach to marketing by specifically targeting a social media-savvy generation. Through online interactions, participants can spread the word virtually and impact other’s opinions.“#FinishIt really is an invitation for this generation to take ownership of this issue and eradicate smoking in their lifetime,” says Eric Asche, Legacy’s chief marketing officer.Using a variety of platforms, including the recent released music video, truth targets this specific demographic both with statistics and celebrity appearances. “Left Swipe Dat” seeks to raise awareness not only on smoking, but on how young adults present themselves online.""The combination of popular music, social media and relationship angst is deadly effective,"" Kocher says.RELATED: Should e-cigarettes be included in tobacco bans on campus? Students discussBased off of recent statistics, truth considers its efforts a success. Only 8% of today’s teens smoke, a stark contrast to the 23% who smoked in 2000 when truth first launched. While a recent study by Ipsos Public Affairs did find that the highest rate of smoking, 23%, is among 18 to 34 year-old, the effects of smoking are becoming more visible.“It’s crazy-awesome to see those conversations happening and it really does show that our generation is going to be the one to finish it and end cigarette smoking once and for all,” says Marburger.Kaitlyn Russell is a student at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and a spring 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.This story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

1,19,318499102,2015-02-12 21:29:51,Case against Argentine president moves forward,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/85238261/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Case-against-Argentine-president-moves-forward/,en,True,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The prosecutor who inherited a high-profile case against Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Friday reaffirmed the accusations, formally renewing the investigation into whether the president helped Iranian officials cover up their alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center.A top government official called the move a ""judicial coup.""Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita's decision to go forward with the case was significant because it sets the stage for a close examination of the investigation that prosecutor Alberto Nisman was building before he was found dead Jan. 18. The next day, Nisman was scheduled to elaborate his accusations to Congress.Nisman accused Fernandez, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and others in her administration of brokering the cover-up in exchange for favorable deals on oil and other goods from Iran. Fernandez and Timerman have strongly denied the accusations, and Iran has repeatedly denied involvement in the bombing, which killed 85 people.In his statement released Friday afternoon, Pollicita recounted Nisman's accusations without providing analysis of them. He concluded that an investigation is necessary to ""achieve a degree of understanding to prove or disprove the factual and dogmatic extremes expressed in the preceding paragraphs.""Pollicita will present his findings to judge Daniel Rafecas, the federal magistrate assigned to the case who will ultimately decide whether to dismiss it or send it on to trial.Meanwhile Friday, three other prosecutors and a coordinator were named to take over Nisman's general investigation into the bombing itself, which he had led for 10 years. No one has been convicted in the case.Even before Pollicita's decision, amid rumors that it was coming, the administration was moving to both reject and minimize it.Cabinet chief Jorge Capitanich called the move a ""judicial coup"" during his daily press briefing.""The Argentine people should know that we're talking about a vulgar lie, of an enormous media operation, of a strategy of political destabilization and the biggest judicial coup d'etat in the history of Argentina to cover the real perpetrators of the crime,"" he said.Similarly, Presidential spokesman Anibal Fernandez said moving the case forward was a ""clear maneuver to destabilize democracy"" but that ultimately ""it has no legal value. It does not matter.""The strength of Nisman's 289-page investigation, presented to a judge a few days after his death, has been hot topic of debate within the legal community.The basis of his case are wiretaps of administration officials allegedly talking about a secret deal around the time of a 2013 ""Memorandum of Understanding"" that Argentina reached with Iran. The agreement, which is being challenged in Argentine courts, on its face sets the conditions for the two countries to investigate the bombing.Juan Jose Avila, a criminal lawyer, said arguing that Nisman's case wasn't strong enough misses the point, because at this stage, no investigation is ready to be tried in court.""No accusation, when it's first made, is proven,"" he said.Associated Press writer Almudena Calatrava contributed to this report.",NA
2,45,318518961,2015-02-12 22:33:23,Men share their thoughts on Valentine's Day,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/85240841/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Men-share-their-thoughts-on-Valentines-Day/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"Valentine’s Day…a holiday dreaded by some and sought after by others. The things to do on this day are almost infinite. Some students may be snuggled up with a loved one, while others may choose to stay at home and treat Feb. 14 like any other day of the year.Regardless of how you choose to spend the holiday, some guys are arguing that the holidays is overrated and played out — merely an excuse to get guys to dish out money on their significant other. Others see Valentine’s Day differently and say that the holiday is a chance to really show your appreciation for someone you care about.To see how college-aged males view Valentine’s Day, here are responses from a select group of men (a.k.a. guys from various colleges) who chose to provide their thoughts.Brett Leary, sophomore at University of Texas at Dallas: The perfect Valentine’s Day isn't something that can be defined by a list of things to do, or a specific ""romantic"" place many individuals choose to go to. It's really defined by who you spend it with, and what you both decide would hold a significant meaning.Gerardo Arce, junior at The University of Texas at Austin: My perfect Valentine's Day (in my current single relationship status) would be a day that I can spend it going out on dates with a number of people individually, rather than all at once (like a social, etc.).RELATED: 5 ways to spend Valentine's Day as a college studentAlexis Vences, senior at The University of Texas at Austin: My perfect Valentine's Day would be spent doing homework naked in the living room with bae over a cup of coffee.Brock West, sophomore at Tarleton State University: To me the perfect Valentine's Day would just be spending the day with my significant other. Doesn't matter what we do, but as long as we are together, that'd be good enough for me.Arce: I currently don't have a significant other. If I had a partner now I would buy him a box of his favorite chocolates, a nice pair of shoes or anything that he really wants. I think the price range would depend on your current budget and special needs.West:As a male, I do feel expected to buy a Valentine's present. I believe the cost should depend on the level of commitment with your significant other.Vences: I do think it's overrated. If I had my way, I'd buy my love interest a small gift the day before and the day after just to prove a point. Why go big on one day when I can show my appreciation every day?Nick Palmateer, senior at Syracuse University: I do think it is overrated, just because it’s a reason to spend a lot of money, but at the same time I think it is a good reminder to treat your loved one to something special every once in a while.  Other than birthdays and Christmas, we really don't have a chance to treat each other that often.  So I guess I do still like it, even if it is overrated.West : I don't think Valentine's Day is an overrated holiday, because it's a day to give people a chance to show how much they care for their significant other. Some people work so much they may not get too, and Valentine's Day is a perfect way to be able to do so.RELATED: Viewpoint: Women need to change Valentine's DayLeary: Like I said, anywhere both individuals agree on and know they will enjoy themselves. Fancy restaurants aren't always the answer, and the price of the food is usually increased on holidays at most fancy restaurants that come to mind. I learned this the hard way.Vences: The perfect date spot would be at a hipster coffee shop downtown. The urban environment makes for a super casual environment. I'm not a partier or anything, so I'd avoid the more raucous parts of town. I'd rather not be covered in barf by the end of the day.Arce: The perfect Valentine's Day spot for me would be having dinner in a nice terrace of the highest floor of a tall and modern building.Leary : What's overdone is the universal thought process of every couple thinking they have to dress up in a tuxedo and an expensive dress, heels, jewelry, etc. All of that is for what? You can have an equally fun time dressing semi-casual, getting food to-go/making your own food and having a picnic or something in a nice park or open field with a view.Vences: Flowers and chocolates are such a generic way to appease to your lover. If you're going to do something nice, be creative and make something by hand. That's the best way to show how much you care about them — by spending real time making a real gift and putting a little bit of yourself into it. It's also like a free pass to things other than their heart.Palmateer: I really don't think there's anything that is overdone.  I would say chocolate or roses, but girls definitely love both (or at least one of the two) and I'm guilty of using both over the last 3+ years several times.Arce: Something that is overdone in Valentine’s Day is going to the same restaurants or places that other couples visit. To me, it would be more intimate and relaxing to spend a time with my partner in a less crowded and quieter space. For single people, a good upgrade would be to simply hang out with other single people or there to make connections and friends, rather than spending time alone at home.Vences: Well, I have to work that morning, but I'll be dressing up in all red with my coworkers to be as festive as possible. Just because I don't have a reason to celebrate Valentine's Day doesn't mean I have to be a grouch about it. We should appreciate the relationships of others because love is something special and deserves to be celebrated.Arce: I am currently openly dating some guys without any commitment. I plan to go out on some dates, get to know more about each of them and also about myself. An important tip to consider about the dating experience for both LGBT and straight people is to take things slowly and assume that you're just going out with someone for the only purpose of a friendship or simply to know each other better. Never rush things since the other person may not have the same interests or plans as you and could back off. Bottom line: have fun, be original, don't be too desperate and don't be too cold either. Sometimes the best things occur when you least expect. Also, no one wants to get disappointed. So just believe in yourself. You always do your best!West:  Since I'm not in a relationship I will be spending it with friends who are also single and ready to mingle.Alex Samuels is a student at the University of Texas at Austin and a spring 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.This story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

3,51,318525987,2015-02-12 23:14:48,Obama bundlers slow to back Clinton super PACS,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/85243142/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Obama-bundlers-slow-to-back-Clinton-super-PACS/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"WASHINGTON — Only a tiny fraction of the fundraisers who helped President Obama secure a second term have made significant contributions to the committee backing a potential run by Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, a USA TODAY analysis shows.Of the 769 individuals and couples who raised money for Obama, just 54 people and firms have donated at least $5,000 to Ready for Hillary, the super PAC that has spent two years working to build grass-roots support for a Clinton campaign, according to the analysis.South Carolina lawyer Richard Harpootlian collected more than $500,000 for Obama's re-election, according to figures released by the president's campaign. However, Harpootlian, a former two-time chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, is sitting on the sidelines in the early stages of the 2016 campaign. ""I don't know that she has generated any sort of enthusiasm or excitement,"" he said of Clinton.""In 2007, the Clinton campaign was more a corporate entity with layers and layers and layers of consultants — Clinton, Inc. — as opposed to a campaign,"" Harpootlian said, referring to the early months of Clinton's unsuccessful primary battle with Obama.""I had hoped that this time around the Clinton campaign would be more agile. But there's no real feeling that there's a campaign. They are acting as if she's the nominee, which is what happened in 2007 — and good golly — that went wrong.""The reluctance of some of Obama's biggest backers to make significant early contributions to the Ready for Hillary super PAC underscores Clinton's slower-than-expected campaign start. The former secretary of State initially had signaled she might make a decision on the 2016 race as early as last month. More recently, the timetable for an announcement was adjusted to as late as July, Politico and other news media outlets report.Ready for Hillary spokesman Seth Bringman said Obama's supporters are playing ""an essential and inspiring role"" in the super PAC's operations. Some of Obama's fundraisers have not written big checks themselves but have joined the group's ""finance council"" and are encouraging others to contribute, he said.Ready for Hillary's ranks also include people who donated to Obama's campaign or the super PAC supporting him, but who did not have a formal fundraising role in his campaign.David Garrison, a Nashville lawyer who raised money for both of Obama's campaigns, has not donated to Ready for Hillary. He said some of Obama's success relied on giving a broad group of party activists and fundraisers — many of whom were new to politics — meaningful roles early in his campaign. He hasn't seen those opportunities emerge so far.""While the Clintons have established ties with Democrats in Tennessee and all around the country, what we haven't seen yet is a Clinton campaign that's built an infrastructure at all various levels of donors and activists,"" Garrison said.""What she didn't do in 2008 — and she has to do now — is build a new coalition beyond the Clintons' storied history in the party,"" he said.In a statement, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said Clinton will ""take nothing for granted"" if she runs and will ""fight for every vote.""As Clinton devises her plans, a crowded field of Republican candidates is jockeying for an edge. Several prominent contenders, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, launched their own fundraising committees in recent weeks.The Republican National Committee has seized on Clinton's slower timetable. On Thursday, RNC operatives posted a mobile billboard at Vice President Biden's events in Iowa, arguing that Clinton's absence from the campaign trail demonstrates that she's ""hiding from voters.""At the same time, squabbling in the network of groups preparing for Clinton's candidacy broke into public view this week when David Brock, a liberal activist who oversees several super PACs backing Clinton, resigned from the board of another pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, in a dispute over fundraising tactics. (Both sides sought to quickly defuse the situation, and Brock has said he will willing to rejoin Priorities' leadership.)Priorities USA Action, which raised nearly $80 million to back Obama's re-election in 2012, was formally reorganized last year to support Clinton. The group raised virtually no money in 2014, which officials said was an intentional plan to avoid siphoning contributions from other Democratic groups working on last year's congressional elections. But it has been dogged by headlines in recent days that it is having problems securing financial commitments for the upcoming campaign.Billionaire financier George Soros, a prominent Democratic donor, has been among the major backers of Brock's organizations. He's also donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary but has not contributed to Priorities since it was reorganized to back Clinton.Michael Vachon, Soros' political adviser, warned against reading too much into that. Soros will ""enthusiastically support Hillary Clinton,"" he said.""To what degree he will be involved in independent expenditures is not something he has yet considered,"" Vachon said, adding that Soros has spent the last year focused ""almost exclusively"" on the crisis in Ukraine.Officials with Priorities USA Action — which includes a mix of veteran Clinton and Obama political operatives and supporters — insist they will raise ample money once Clinton's campaign to become the nation's first female president is in full swing.""Make no mistake, we will have the resources we need to be effective and to work with our allies to help elect Hillary Clinton in 2016,"" Jonathan Mantz, Clinton's 2008 finance director and a senior adviser to Priorities, said in a statement.The USA TODAY analysis compared the list of 769 individuals and couples who raised money for Obama's 2012 campaign with donors who contributed at least $5,000 to Ready for Hillary since the super PAC's launch in January 2013. The 54 matches include companies and spouses of Obama fundraisers that USA TODAY could identify.As a super PAC, Ready for Hillary can accept unlimited funds but has capped its contributions at $25,000. It has built a list of 3 million supporters that will be a valuable asset for a Clinton campaign.Jerome Pandell, a lawyer in Walnut Creek, Calif., who raised about $400,000 for Obama, has attended several Ready for Hillary fundraisers but has focused more on local races in the last year.Although he has not written big checks yet, Pandell said he stands ready to help Clinton in any way he can. He also maintains that Clinton doesn't need to rush into the 2016 fray.""She's a known quality,"" he said. ""She doesn't have to introduce herself.""",NA
