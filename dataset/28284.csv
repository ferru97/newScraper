It's typically signifies that someone is either uninteresting or unattractive. But what really makes someone left swipe on a photo? For some users, it’s cigarettes.The marketing campaigntruth has worked to end smoking among young adults since 2000, launched its latest video “Left Swipe Dat” as part of its #FinishIt campaign. Legacy, a leader in public health, created the video which premiered during the Feb. 8 Grammy Awards.Artists -- including Becky G, Fifth Harmony and King Bach -- star in the video, which argues that it’s unattractive for a person to post photos of himself or herself smoking on social media. While some young adults may find smoking attractive, a study by found that people get nearly double the matches on dating apps if they are not smoking in their profile pictures.Cas Marburger, who manages social media for truth, says she couldn’t have asked for a better response from young adults.RELATED: Despite risks, students embrace hookah trend“The celebs and icons in the music video -- like Becky G, Fifth Harmony, King Bach and the intergalactic dolphins -- have been absolute champions,” Marburger says. “Their participation and support of truth has sparked a firestorm of people talking about why they choose not to smoke, chose to quit smoking or why they’re down to help #LeftSwipeDat.”Sarah Kocher, student at Augustana College says the advertisement was one of the most ""clever"" she has seen.""I have spoken to several other students about the video because I loved it so much,” Kocher says. “One of my friends also said she thought it was genius and quite well done."".In an effort to end both social and everyday smoking, truth argues that Millennials can put a stop to tobacco use. The organization goes beyond informing viewers about traditional forms of tobacco consumption, such as smoking cigarettes, by highlighting the dangers of newer trends like hookah and flavored cigars.RELATED: Is Iowa's legal smoking age about to go up in flames?Various smoking facts are posted on the truth website. For example, #230 says, “in an average one-hour hookah session, you inhale 100 to 200 times as much smoke as from a single cigarette.”The #FinishIt campaign takes a different approach to marketing by specifically targeting a social media-savvy generation. Through online interactions, participants can spread the word virtually and impact other’s opinions.“#FinishIt really is an invitation for this generation to take ownership of this issue and eradicate smoking in their lifetime,” says Eric Asche, Legacy’s chief marketing officer.Using a variety of platforms, including the recent released music video, truth targets this specific demographic both with statistics and celebrity appearances. “Left Swipe Dat” seeks to raise awareness not only on smoking, but on how young adults present themselves online.""The combination of popular music, social media and relationship angst is deadly effective,"" Kocher says.RELATED: Should e-cigarettes be included in tobacco bans on campus? Students discussBased off of recent statistics, truth considers its efforts a success. Only 8% of today’s teens smoke, a stark contrast to the 23% who smoked in 2000 when truth first launched. While a recent study by Ipsos Public Affairs did find that the highest rate of smoking, 23%, is among 18 to 34 year-old, the effects of smoking are becoming more visible.“It’s crazy-awesome to see those conversations happening and it really does show that our generation is going to be the one to finish it and end cigarette smoking once and for all,” says Marburger.Kaitlyn Russell is a student at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and a spring 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.This story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

19,318499102,2015-02-12 21:29:51,Case against Argentine president moves forward,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/85238261/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Case-against-Argentine-president-moves-forward/,en,True,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,Peter Prengaman,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The prosecutor who inherited a high-profile case against Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Friday reaffirmed the accusations, formally renewing the investigation into whether the president helped Iranian officials cover up their alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center.A top government official called the move a ""judicial coup.""Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita's decision to go forward with the case was significant because it sets the stage for a close examination of the investigation that prosecutor Alberto Nisman was building before he was found dead Jan. 18. The next day, Nisman was scheduled to elaborate his accusations to Congress.Nisman accused Fernandez, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and others in her administration of brokering the cover-up in exchange for favorable deals on oil and other goods from Iran. Fernandez and Timerman have strongly denied the accusations, and Iran has repeatedly denied involvement in the bombing, which killed 85 people.In his statement released Friday afternoon, Pollicita recounted Nisman's accusations without providing analysis of them. He concluded that an investigation is necessary to ""achieve a degree of understanding to prove or disprove the factual and dogmatic extremes expressed in the preceding paragraphs.""Pollicita will present his findings to judge Daniel Rafecas, the federal magistrate assigned to the case who will ultimately decide whether to dismiss it or send it on to trial.Meanwhile Friday, three other prosecutors and a coordinator were named to take over Nisman's general investigation into the bombing itself, which he had led for 10 years. No one has been convicted in the case.Even before Pollicita's decision, amid rumors that it was coming, the administration was moving to both reject and minimize it.Cabinet chief Jorge Capitanich called the move a ""judicial coup"" during his daily press briefing.""The Argentine people should know that we're talking about a vulgar lie, of an enormous media operation, of a strategy of political destabilization and the biggest judicial coup d'etat in the history of Argentina to cover the real perpetrators of the crime,"" he said.Similarly, Presidential spokesman Anibal Fernandez said moving the case forward was a ""clear maneuver to destabilize democracy"" but that ultimately ""it has no legal value. It does not matter.""The strength of Nisman's 289-page investigation, presented to a judge a few days after his death, has been hot topic of debate within the legal community.The basis of his case are wiretaps of administration officials allegedly talking about a secret deal around the time of a 2013 ""Memorandum of Understanding"" that Argentina reached with Iran. The agreement, which is being challenged in Argentine courts, on its face sets the conditions for the two countries to investigate the bombing.Juan Jose Avila, a criminal lawyer, said arguing that Nisman's case wasn't strong enough misses the point, because at this stage, no investigation is ready to be tried in court.""No accusation, when it's first made, is proven,"" he said.Associated Press writer Almudena Calatrava contributed to this report."
